- **Backing up data**: You can also use the cloud to protect your files. Apps like [Mozy](http://mozy.com/) and [Carbonite](http://www.carbonite.com) automatically back up your data to the cloud. This way, if  your computer ever is lost, stolen, or 
  damaged, you'll still be able to recover these files from the cloud.
